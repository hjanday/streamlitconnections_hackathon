My entry to the Streamlit Connections Hackathon


## Data Source
My current data source is the the city of Toronto's dining safety dataset (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/dinesafe/)
My current aim is to visualize and perform analytics on the safety of food establishments in the city 
and provide insight into the worst offenders and the areas with the highest food safety
